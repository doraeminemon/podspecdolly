  "body": "# Podspecdolly\r\n\r\nAs the global podspec on github of Cocoapods is growing larger, any process involving cocoapod is a pain especially if your project has 10 or more dependencies. The option is to run a local or self-hosted podspec. This tool will allow you to rely totally on your own podspec by cloning only the pods that you want, based on a podfile, without the need to send a pull request to Cocoapods/Specs\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'podspecdolly'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install podspecdolly\r\n\r\nI didn't release it on rubygems.org yet. Download or clone this git\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n- cd to a folder with a podfile\r\n- $ podspecdolly clone\r\n- All currently missing version of podspec will be download to a Specs folder\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nFeatures that are missing and are planned for next release, arrange from most to least prioritized :\r\n- Automatically download pod dependencies\r\n- Allow clone from other sources\r\n- Writing tests\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/doraeminemon/podspecdolly.
